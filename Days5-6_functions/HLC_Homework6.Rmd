#### Exercise 1

Use `genPrimer` from functions day 1 to generate a list of 20 primers that are between 20-30 base pairs in length.

```{r}
```

Write a for loop that prints "primer is between 20 and 24 bases" if the primer has 20 or more bases and 24 or fewer bases. 

```{r}
```

#### Exercise 2

Write a function that takes as input a gapminder dataset from 2002 and a specified continent, and prints out the list of countries.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)

gap2002 <- filter(gapminder, year==2002)
