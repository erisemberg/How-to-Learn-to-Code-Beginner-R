#### Exercise 1

Use `genPrimer` from functions day 1 to generate a list of 20 primers that are between 20-30 base pairs in length.

```{r}
```

Write a for loop that prints "primer is between 20 and 24 bases" if the primer has 20 or more bases and 24 or fewer bases. 

```{r}
```

#### Exercise 2

Make a vector of the days of the week:

```{r}
```

Use sapply to create a vector that contains abbreviations for the days of the week using days. Use an if/else statement to keep just the first character of each day of the week that starts with a unique letter (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), but keep two characters for days that start with the same letter as another day (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday).

Hint: use the function substr to extract a subset of the characters from a character string.

```{r}
```
